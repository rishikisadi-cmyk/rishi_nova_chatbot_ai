Explain Frequency Division Multiplexing (FDM) with an example.**\n\nFrequency Division Multiplexing (FDM) is a technique in which the total bandwidth of a communication channel is divided into smaller frequency bands. Each signal is transmitted simultaneously using a unique carrier frequency. This allows multiple signals to share the same communication channel without interfering with each other.\n\n**Example:**\nFM radio stations transmit on different frequencies like 91.1 MHz and 93.5 MHz. In this example, the total bandwidth of the communication channel is divided into two smaller frequency bands: one for 91.1 MHz and another for 93.5 MHz. Each radio station uses a unique carrier frequency, and guard bands are used to avoid overlap between the two frequencies.\n\nIn this way, multiple signals can be transmitted simultaneously over the same communication channel using FDM, increasing the overall efficiency of the communication system."

The system must represent spatial and relational knowledge about \nobjects in the room. \n  \ni) Explain which approach to knowledge representation (logical, semantic network, frame-based, or \nproduction rule) would best suit this application and justify your choice.  \n  \nii) Discuss two major issues in knowledge representation that may arise when the robot encounters \nnew or ambiguous objects and propose possible AI-based solutions. \n \nAnswer: \n(i) \nThe frame-based representation is most suitable. \n\uf0b7 Frames represent knowledge as structured units (slots and values) describing each object (e.g., table, \nchair, cup) with attributes such as location, color, purpose, etc. \n\uf0b7 This structure allows inheritance (e.g., all chairs have legs) and contextual reasoning (e.g., cups \nbelong on tables, not floors). \n\uf0b7 When the robot perceives the environment, it can match sensory data with stored frames and update \nmissing attributes dynamically. \nHence, frame-based representation enables efficient organization, reasoning, and real-time updates, \nmaking it ideal for robotic perception and planning. \n(ii) \nIssues and Solutions: \n1. Incomplete or uncertain knowledge: \no When the robot detects an unfamiliar object, it lacks full information to classify it. \no Solution: Use probabilistic reasoning (e.g., Bayesian networks) to infer likely object types based on \ncontext and past experiences. \n2. Scalability and consistency: \no As the robot learns more objects, maintaining consistent relationships becomes complex. \no Solution: Implement ontology-based mapping for hierarchical organization and automated \nconsistency checks. \nThus, combining frame-based representation with probabilistic and ontology reasoning enhances \nadaptability and intelligence in complex environments. \n  \n1.

The system must represent spatial and relational knowledge about \nobjects in the room. \n  \ni) Explain which approach to knowledge representation (logical, semantic network, frame-based, or \nproduction rule) would best suit this application and justify your choice.  \n  \nii) Discuss two major issues in knowledge representation that may arise when the robot encounters \nnew or ambiguous objects and propose possible AI-based solutions. \n \nAnswer: \n(i) \nThe frame-based representation is most suitable. \n\uf0b7 Frames represent knowledge as structured units (slots and values) describing each object (e.g., table, \nchair, cup) with attributes such as location, color, purpose, etc. \n\uf0b7 This structure allows inheritance (e.g., all chairs have legs) and contextual reasoning (e.g., cups \nbelong on tables, not floors). \n\uf0b7 When the robot perceives the environment, it can match sensory data with stored frames and update \nmissing attributes dynamically. \nHence, frame-based representation enables efficient organization, reasoning, and real-time updates, \nmaking it ideal for robotic perception and planning. \n(ii) \nIssues and Solutions: \n1. Incomplete or uncertain knowledge: \no When the robot detects an unfamiliar object, it lacks full information to classify it. \no Solution: Use probabilistic reasoning (e.g., Bayesian networks) to infer likely object types based on \ncontext and past experiences. \n2. Scalability and consistency: \no As the robot learns more objects, maintaining consistent relationships becomes complex. \no Solution: Implement ontology-based mapping for hierarchical organization and automated \nconsistency checks. \nThus, combining frame-based representation with probabilistic and ontology reasoning enhances \nadaptability and intelligence in complex environments. \n  \n1.
